# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

I'm taking this oppurtunity to work in C (which I love doing, but I don't really get the chance because I don't work in a relevant domain) and implement a lot of datastructures (which you've got to build it at least once if you want to use a common implementation). This isn't anything critical so don't expect too much error checking unless it really becomes a problem for me.

Feel free to look around if you so desire!

## Completed So Far

Arrays - Complete

Linked List - Complete

Stack - In Progress

Queue - Soon(TM)

## Notes

I'm not using compile time arrays, because I want to have as much control as possible (well as much as I can get with the code still being portable in C ie. no x86).
