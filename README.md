# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

I really didn't feel like I implemented enough of the important (and interesting) data structures and algoritms in my university class. Soooooo, here I'm going through as many important and interesting ones that I can find (even the basics).

I'm just using C (started with C++, but that got real gross, real fast). 

## Completed So Far

Arrays - Complete
Linked List - In Progress

## Notes

I'm not using compile time arrays, because I want to be as close to base as possible (Well I'm not managing my own memory, but that level is just too far from the challenge).
