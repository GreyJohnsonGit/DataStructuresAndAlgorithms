# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

I really didn't feel like I implemented enough of the important (and interesting) data structures and algoritms in my university class. Soooooo, here I'm going through as many important and interesting ones that I can find (even the basics).

I'm just using C (started with C++, but that got real gross real fast). 

In addition, I'm getting some practice in with test driven development (no tools, just some boilerplate testing functions).

## Completed So Far

Nothing! We all have to start somewhere!

## Notes

It's going to be linux dependant because I want to make the console colorful!
