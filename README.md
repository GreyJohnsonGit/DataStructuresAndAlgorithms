# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

I really didn't feel like I implemented enough of the important (and interesting) data structures and algoritms in my university class. Soooooo, here I'm going through as many important and interesting ones that I can find.

I'm just using C (started with C++, but I felt like it was overkill). 

In addition, I'm getting some practice in with test driven development (no tools, just some boilerplate testing classes).

## Completed So Far

Nothing! We all have to start somewhere!

## Notes

It's Windows dependant! If you (for some odd reason) wanted to run the code, you will have to modify PrintC.hpp as it uses the windows functions to print to console with colors.
